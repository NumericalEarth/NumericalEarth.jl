##### Child prognostics computed on the parent grid: the "combine-then-interpolate" state exchange
#####
#
# The child (Breeze `CompressibleDynamics`) prognostic variables — dry density `ρᵈ`, momentum densities
# `ρu`/`ρv`, potential-temperature density `ρθ`, and vapor density `ρqᵛ` — are computed from the raw
# parent (ERA5) specific state *on the parent grid* and stored as a `FieldTimeSeries` holding the
# resident time window that brackets the child's clock (memory-O(1) in time for streaming parents, full
# memory when the parent is full-memory). A downstream child boundary condition / forcing then
# interpolates these precomputed prognostics in space + time. Computing the
# nonlinear combines on the dense parent grid first (then interpolating) is both cheaper — once per
# parent time level rather than per child node per RK stage — and more faithful than interpolating the
# raw fields and combining afterward.
#
# Density weighting matches Breeze's `establish_densities!`/`set!` (dry density is the prognostic):
#   ρ   = p / (Rᵐ T)             (total moist density),   Rᵐ = (1 − qᵗ) Rᵈ + qᵛ Rᵛ  (condensate loads the mixture)
#   qᵗ  = qᵛ + qˡ + qⁱ,   qˡ = qᶜˡ + qʳ (all liquid), qⁱ = qᶜⁱ + qˢ (all ice)
#   ρᵈ  = ρ (1 − qᵗ)                                    ← the prognostic (dry) density
#   ρθ  = ρᵈ · θˡⁱ,   ρu = ρᵈ · u,   ρv = ρᵈ · v         ← DRY-weighted (energy + momentum)
#   ρqᵛ = ρ · qᵛ                                         ← TOTAL-weighted (moisture mass density)
