# # Coupled conservation on a z-star grid
#
# In this example, we run a minimal-physics `OceanSeaIceModel` through a freeze-then-melt cycle on a
# free-surface-following (z-star) grid, and verify that three coupled budgets close to machine precision:
# volume, salt, and energy. The setup is a small doubly periodic ocean with thermodynamics-only sea ice,
# a snow layer on top of the ice, and a uniform prescribed atmosphere. We drive two phases: a cold phase with
# light snowfall that grows the ice, and a warm phase with rainfall that melts it.
#
# On a z-star grid the freshwater flux ``J^w`` forces the free surface, so the ocean genuinely gains and loses
# volume. That makes each budget a statement about quantities we can measure directly from the model state:
#
# ```math
# ΔV = \int \dot{M} / ρ^{oc} \, \mathrm{d}t, \qquad Δ𝒮 = 0, \qquad ΔE = \int (𝒬 + 𝒬^H) \, \mathrm{d}t
# ```
#
# Each budget is stored in two places, the ocean and the ice, which exchange it internally while the atmosphere
# supplies the rest. The stored volume ``V = V^{oc} + M_{is} / ρ^{oc}`` — ocean water plus the volume the ice and
# snow mass would occupy as ocean water — changes by the atmospheric freshwater input ``\dot{M}`` (precipitation
# minus evaporation). The total salt ``𝒮 = 𝒮^{oc} + 𝒮^{ice}`` does not change at all: the atmosphere delivers only
# freshwater, so the ocean and the ice can only pass salt between them as the ice freezes and melts. Rain and
# meltwater dilute the ocean by growing its volume — that volume carries ``S^N J^w`` back in and cancels the
# virtual salt flux — so they change salinity without creating or destroying salt. Finally the stored energy
# ``E = ℋ^{oc} + E_{is}`` changes by the atmospheric heat flux ``𝒬`` together with the enthalpy ``𝒬^H`` that the
# freshwater carries across the surface with its volume. Closure to machine precision requires that every
# internal flux cancels exactly between the components.

# ## Constant latent heat for diagnostic closure
#
# `ClimaSeaIce`'s slab mass balance uses a temperature-dependent latent heat, `ℒ(T) = ℒ₀ + (ρℓ * cℓ / ρi − ci)(T − T₀)`,
# with `ℰu = ρi * ℒ(T_u)` at the top interface and `ℰb = ρi * ℒ(T_b)` at the bottom. A single state-based
# `Eᵢₛ = − ℵ * ρi * ℒ * h * Az` cannot simultaneously match freeze at `T_b` and top-melt at 0 ᵒC: the 4.7 kJ/kg gap accounts
# for a ~1% residual scaling with top-melt mass. To isolate coupler-side bookkeeping from this intrinsic `ℒ(T)` mismatch we
# locally override `latent_heat` to the constant `pt.reference_latent_heat`. This is a diagnostic choice for the present
# example and does not modify upstream.

# ## Grid, ocean, sea ice, atmosphere, and radiation

# The ocean is 100 m deep with 10 levels on a doubly periodic `RectilinearGrid` whose vertical coordinate is a
# `MutableVerticalDiscretization`, so the levels stretch and compress with the free surface. A `SplitExplicitFreeSurface`
# lets the surface respond to the freshwater flux, and tracer advection carries the grid-motion term that the live
# surface-value exchange in the tracer boundary conditions cancels. The domain is horizontally resolved because a
# single z-star column is degenerate. The ocean starts just above freezing at `S = 34`, without momentum advection
# nor Coriolis and with `CATKEVerticalDiffusivity` providing vertical mixing.
