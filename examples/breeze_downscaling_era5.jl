# # ERA5 → 3 km convection-permitting hindcast (Breeze + NestedSimulation)
#
# A limited-area model (LAM) example that downscales ERA5 reanalysis to a 3 km Breeze compressible
# atmosphere over the U.S. Southern Great Plains, for the Midlatitude Continental
# Convective Clouds Experiment (MC3E) 20 May 2011 squall-line case ([Fan2017](@citet)).
# `nested_atmosphere_model(parent, child_grid; …)` builds a `NestedModel`, which pairs a "parent"
# `PrescribedAtmosphere` with a "child" Breeze `AtmosphereModel`. The parent here is an ERA5
# `PrescribedAtmosphere` (on its native 0.25° pressure-level grid), driving a ~3 km Breeze child
# through open lateral boundary conditions + interior Davies relaxation — both derived on the fly from
# the parent's raw state. A plain `Simulation(model)` then steps it (the `NestedModel`'s `time_step!`
# advances the child and ticks the parent clock).
#
# ## What this example does
# - Downloads ERA5 (pressure + single levels) for a fixed parent region and regrids it onto a
#   terrain-following `LatitudeLongitudeGrid` (ETOPO2022 orography, tapered to the parent at the edge).
# - Initializes the prognostic state from ERA5 with a hydrostatic-from-surface pressure and a
#   terrain-consistent `w̃ ≈ 0`; a dynamical-initialization (DFI) pass then spins `ρw` into balance.
# - Integrates the compressible equations with split-explicit acoustic substepping (adaptive
#   substeps + an adaptive outer-Δt wizard), 1-moment mixed-phase microphysics, Coriolis, a
#   reference-θ perturbation-form pressure-gradient, bulk surface drag, and Rayleigh damping.
# - Writes and animates horizontal slices.
#
# ## What it does NOT do (yet)
# - Single nest only (ERA5 → 3 km). The window here is 2 h to keep the example short; the full MC3E
#   study in [Fan2017](@citet) was run for 18 h, with most analyses performed between 6 and 12 h.
# - No land/ocean coupling (surface stress is a bulk-drag stand-in; the SlabLand MOST link is unwired).
# - No boundary layer parameterization: diffusion is provided by numerical dissipation.
# - No cumulus parameterization: 3 km is convection-*permitting*, so deep convection is resolved on
#   the grid.
# - No `RectilinearGrid` (constant Δx, Δy) with map projection.
#
# ## What we attempted / known issues
# - First set up as a telescoping nest: ERA5 → 9 km → 3 km. The 9 km middle nest sits in the convective
#   grey zone, where under-resolved convection runs away (a vertical-mixing band-aid bounds but never
#   makes it physical). Reducing to ERA5 → 3 km direct sidesteps the 9 km grey zone.
# - The split-explicit cold start disables `ThermalDivergenceDamping` (`NoDivergenceDamping`): its
#   (ρθ)′-proxy damper injects a spurious force on the unbalanced start (Breeze #793).
# - The resolved 3 km convection is still vigorous (deep updrafts, locally high max|w|); a physically
#   robust multi-hour run needs explicit convective treatment / horizontal mixing — deferred. This
#   example demonstrates the wired stack runs end-to-end; physical validity of the convection is
#   future work.
# - A DFI cycle-count sensitivity study (1/2/4/8 adiabatic balance cycles) found the post-DFI max|w|
#   is already ~0.6 m/s after a single cycle and the subsequent max|w| growth is insensitive to the
#   cycle count — the deep updrafts are CAPE-driven at grey-zone resolution, not seeded by the
#   initialization transient. A single balance cycle therefore suffices (`balance_cycles = 1`).
# - Near-surface initialization transient: the ERA5 winds are set on the terrain-following grid as-is,
#   in balance with neither surface drag nor the model's pressure field. The lowest cell samples the
#   free-atmosphere ERA5 wind — strongest over high terrain, where k=1 sits ~1 km above sea level — so
#   the near-surface |U| sheds ~25% in the first ~0.5 h as surface drag spins up and the flow
#   geostrophically adjusts (DFI balances ρw, not the horizontal momentum). A balanced / terrain-aware
#   wind initialization, or a DFI that also balances horizontal momentum, would reduce it; motivates
#   further development of the initialization routine.

# (dashed rectangle = the 3 km child extent); row 2 is the Breeze child. Columns are the near-surface
# wind speed `|U|` and the virtual potential temperature perturbation θᵥ′, then `w`, `qᵛ`, `qʳ` at 2 km
# AGL. θᵥ′ is referenced to the initial state — θᵥ′ = θᵥ − θᵥ(t=0), pointwise — so the terrain and
# stratification background (which would swamp an anomaly-from-domain-mean over this terrain) cancels,
# leaving the evolving cold pool. Row 1 reconstructs the parent prognostics on the fly from the ERA5
# `PrescribedAtmosphere` at the child's frame times, at the same two levels as the child. ERA5's `w` is estimated from its pressure velocity ω as
# w ≈ −ω/(ρg) (synoptic-scale, far weaker than the child's resolved convection); `qʳ` is blank (no model rain).
